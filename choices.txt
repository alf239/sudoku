Collection of "design" choices in no particular order collected here for no apparent reason.

1. Testing. TDD is cool, but ties hands way too early

2. Constructor. Constructor does not follow the PHP example, as in Java throwing an exception
in constructor is considered a bad practice.

3. Command line argument VS resources. For the end user, CLI is better; for testing, resources are handy.

4. The notion of `isValid` is very relaxed: e.g., line 222 222 222 will be fine. What saves us is that elimination
step will bring this line into an invalid state on its next turn, so we're just postponing the solution
(we don't want out check for validity to be NP hard)
